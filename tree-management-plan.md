# Graphical Tree Management Page - Implementation Plan

After reviewing the existing codebase, I have a good understanding of the project structure and requirements. The goal is to create a graphically-based tree management page where users can easily build out family trees by adding and connecting nodes, with each node displaying a thumbnail of the person.

## Current State Analysis

The application already has:
- A data model with Trees, People, Nodes, Media, and Layouts
- API endpoints for managing these entities
- Form components for adding trees, people, and media
- A basic FamilyTree component, but it's not fully integrated with the backend data model
- A tree management page that's currently form-based with dropdown selections

## Requirements for the Graphical Tree Management Page

1. **Visual Node Representation**:
   - Display person thumbnails in nodes
   - Show basic person information
   - Visually pleasing and intuitive layout

2. **Interactive Capabilities**:
   - Add new nodes (people) to the tree
   - Connect nodes to represent relationships
   - Add parents or siblings when clicking a node
   - View and edit node information

3. **Usability Features**:
   - Zoom and pan capabilities for larger trees
   - Intuitive UI for adding relationships
   - Visual cues for possible connections
   - Easy access to common actions

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Design the Enhanced Tree Management Page

Create a new tree management page with these sections:
- A tree selector (to choose which tree to work with)
- A main canvas area for displaying and interacting with the tree
- A toolbox or panel for adding nodes and managing the tree

### 2. Enhance the Node Component

Improve the TreeNode component to:
- Display the person's primary image as a thumbnail
- Show essential information (name, birth/death dates)
- Include UI elements for adding/editing connections

### 3. Develop the Interactive Canvas

Create a canvas component that:
- Displays nodes and connections
- Supports basic zooming and panning
- Organizes nodes in a vertical hierarchy with uniform organization
- Has a primary/starting node with connected nodes on all sides

### 4. Implement Node Connection Management

Design the UI and logic for:
- Creating parent-child and sibling connections between nodes
- Specifying relationship types (parent, child, spouse, etc.)
- Visually representing different relationship types
- Deleting or modifying connections

### 5. Create a Simplified Node Creation Workflow

Design a workflow that allows users to:
- Add a new person directly to the tree
- Specify relationships during creation
- Upload an image during creation (or select from existing media)

### 6. Update API for Node Connections

Ensure backend support for:
- Creating and managing connections between nodes
- Retrieving complete tree data efficiently

### 7. Add Usability Enhancements

Implement features to improve usability:
- Context menus for quick actions
- Undo/redo capability
- Simple navigation for larger trees

## Detailed Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

1. **TreeCanvas.svelte** - The main component that:
   - Renders the entire tree
   - Handles zoom and pan
   - Manages the selection state
   - Automatically arranges nodes in a hierarchical structure

2. **EnhancedTreeNode.svelte** - An improved node component that:
   - Shows the person's image and details
   - Handles interaction events (click to select)
   - Displays connection points for relationships
   - Supports selection state

3. **NodeConnectionLine.svelte** - For visualizing connections between nodes:
   - Draws lines between nodes
   - Indicates relationship types
   - Handles selection for editing

4. **NodeActions.svelte** - UI component for node operations:
   - Add parent
   - Add sibling
   - Add child
   - Edit/delete node

### Backend Enhancements

1. **Node API Extensions**:
   - Create/update/delete connections between nodes
   - Bulk operations for efficiency

2. **Data Model Adjustments**:
   - Ensure the Node model can represent all required relationship types
   - Add additional metadata for visual representation if needed

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Visual Tree Representation
- Create enhanced canvas and node components
- Display existing tree data visually
- Implement basic zoom and pan functionality

### Phase 2: Node Hierarchy Visualization
- Implement automatic node positioning in a vertical hierarchy
- Create uniform organization of nodes around a primary node
- Build the logic to maintain the hierarchy when adding new nodes

### Phase 3: Connection Management
- Implement connection creation UI
- Add relationship type selection
- Visualize different connection types

### Phase 4: Node Creation/Editing
- Create streamlined workflow for adding people
- Implement media selection/upload in the flow
- Add node editing capabilities

### Phase 5: Refinement and Polish
- Add simple undo/redo functionality
- Add performance optimizations for large trees
- Add basic animations for better user experience

## Technical Considerations

1. **Performance**:
   - Keep the rendering efficient for medium-sized trees
   - Use efficient data structures for tree operations
   - Optimize network requests and caching

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure keyboard navigation
   - Add proper ARIA attributes
   - Maintain good color contrast

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful handling of network issues
   - Support for offline editing and syncing
   - Clear error messages and recovery options

## User Experience Flow

1. User selects a tree from their collection
2. The tree displays visually with existing people and connections
3. User can:
   - Click a node to see details and relationship options (add parent, add sibling)
   - Add new people through the relationship interfaces
   - Navigate the tree structure easily
4. All changes save automatically or with explicit save actions

## Technology Recommendations

### JavaScript Libraries for Tree Visualization:
- **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)**: Powerful visualization library that would work well for custom tree layouts
- **[Svelte Motion](https://svelte-motion.gradientdescent.de/)**: For smooth animations and transitions
- **[Panzoom](https://github.com/timmywil/panzoom)**: Lightweight library for pan and zoom functionality

### UI Component Libraries:
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: Already in use in the project, great for custom UI
- **[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)**: Tailwind component library that could speed up development

### File/Image Handling:
- Continue using Cloudinary for image storage and transformation
- Consider adding client-side image cropping for better thumbnails

## Mock-up Screens

1. **Main Tree Visualization**:
   - Central area showing the family tree with nodes and connections
   - Toolbar at the top with common actions
   - Zoom controls

2. **Node Selection Panel**:
   - Shows when a node is selected
   - Displays full person information
   - Quick actions for editing/deleting
   - Media gallery for the person

3. **Add Person Flow**:
   - Modal or slide-in panel
   - Form for person details with relationship context (e.g., "Adding parent for John Smith")
   - Media upload/selection
   - Relationship selection to connect to existing nodes

4. **Relationship Options**:
   - Simple UI for selecting relationship type when adding a new person
   - Dropdown for relationship type
   - Visual feedback on valid/invalid connections
